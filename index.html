There are normal user and Super User:
- Different is their previlegs 
- normal user can create , delete , edit their own file 
- Can not make chages on system configuration , they cant install software , or system file or other user files 

* Super User :
- can modify any file on the system 
- can make system-wide changes 
______________________________________________________
- su stand for substitute users. 
- Eg: Bob to Piseth account : su bob then his pw.

______________________________________________________

- sudo ls /root - to gain previleges
- sudo -K - to give up  previleges
- sudo -s - to log in to the root shell : # is indicated that you are in root file . to exit type exit.

---------Permission Determine Access to Files ----------------

rwxrwxrwx file1 

The first section is indicated for User : rwx

The second  section is indicated for Group: rwx 

The third section is indicated for Other : rwx

RWX:  Stand for Read Write and Execute 

--------- Change  Files Permission ----------------

chmod - change Permission mode string 

Chown and chgrp - change the file's owner and group 

Two method to represent Permission:

**Octal Value Permission:**

- Octal (755, 644 , 777 )
Read = 4 
Write = 2 
Execute = 1 

if User r w x that would be 7 , 4+2+1

if Group r - X that would be 5 , 4+1

if other r - - that would be 4 

- Another way to write it is rwxr-xr-- same thing to 754


**Symblic Value Permission:**
- Symblic (a=r , g+w,  o-x)

** Try Octal Value Permission:**


test.sh currently with permission : -rwxr-xr-x

I want to remove user permission excexute : so the command would be :

chmod 644 test.sh - Octal way 
chmod -x test.sh - Symblic way 


--------- Command CAT ----------------


- cat used to output the content of the file:


--------- Nano CAT ----------------

nano test.sh - enter text editor 

sudo chown root test.sh - change file owner to test.sh


--------- Links File ----------------
- Links are files that reference other files 
- used to avoid having duplicate file 
- AS link establishes a pointer in one place to a destination in other place.
-

--------- Two Type of Links ----------------

- Symblic and Hard Links :



- Symblic point to the file on the disk  (ln command)
-Eg: ln -s poems.txt  (source file) (then the link I want to create ) writing.txt
- lrwxrwxrwx - l is a link 

- Hard Link point to specific data on the disk :

- ln poems.txt words.txt

- Think of a link with two door , which ever you door you want to use, you will able to do so.
